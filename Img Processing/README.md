# Image Processing:
---

Image Processing is the method to perform some operations on an image in order to get enhanced, analyzed image. It is a technical analysis of an image by using complex algorithms. Image Processing include three steps: First image used as an image input then analyzing the image and then return as the output. It is used to implement face recognize functionalities, detect and recognize object and action in image. Neural network is used for image processing tasks.  
Image processing is widely used in different fields like in medical field, image sharpening and restoration and so on.
Image sharpening and restoration use image processing to make them better image or to manipulate those image in way to achieve desired result from the original image. It include to zoom image, blur image, sharp image etc. In the medical filed image processing is use in X-ray imagining, blood/cellular microscope image and vice versa.

## Why Do We Need Image Processing?

Image processing is often viewed as arbitrarily manipulating an image to achieve an aesthetic standard or to support a preferred reality. However, image processing is more accurately defined as a means of translation between the human visual system and digital imaging devices. The human visual system does not perceive the world in the same manner as digital detectors, with display devices imposing additional noise and bandwidth restrictions. Salient differences between the human and digital detectors will be shown, along with some basic processing steps for achieving translation. Image processing must be approached in a manner consistent with the scientific method so that others may reproduce, and validate, one's results. This includes recording and reporting processing actions, and applying similar treatments to adequate control images.
